# Pack Street: The Game
### Really just a testbed for the javascript game thing I've been writing.

## About the game

It's a browser-based text game. You go from room to room interacting with characters. You can have sex with them, too, I guess.

## Play the game

DarkEdition allows the options EnableGore and EnableRape to be toggle on or off. The content shown after that is self-explanatory.

LightEdition does not allow the options EnableGore and EnableRape to be toggle on.

EnableGore and EnableRape are disable by default.
