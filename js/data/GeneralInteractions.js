You&apos;ve played this game out before, and she always ends up ‘running into a doorknob,&apos; or ‘falling down some stairs.&apos; She gasps as your teeth bite at her neck, eliciting fake moans. Not good enough.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You bite down hard, hard enough to break the skin, hard enough to draw blood, hard enough to get a real scream from Charlie. And scream she did, as a rivulet of blood escaped her body and touched your tongue. You pull back, lips painted red, Charlie gasping, not looking at you. You&apos;ve stopped, just for a moment. The other animals in the apartment know better than to interrupt you and Charlie&apos;s play time, no.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>Something else made you stop. It was the taste in your mouth. Rich, warm, a bit like sucking on a penny. It was blood, Charlie&apos;s blood, and the liquid slips down your throat before you could even think of savoring it. But the source was still here, shivering and looking away, closing her eyes, just hoping you&apos;d be quick. You never were.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You lick her wound, pushing the greasy fur out of the way to lap at the blood. Charlie&apos;s hygiene always disgusted you, but you could bare her greasy fur and mange if it meant this. The rivulet become a trickle as you caress her neck, and you pull taste less and less blood with each kiss. Your jaw comes down in the same place again, almost free of your will.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>She screams as they close, and struggles away, leaving behind the chunk of flesh in your teeth. You gnash it against the top of your mouth, forcing out the last delicious sample of blood before you spit it out. Charlie holds a paw to her neck, and she has that same look of fear that you love so much on her face, that look that she had worn ever since you met her.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You walk towards her, but today was the day she had chosen to fight, and she held a frying pan between you like a sword. Your skull connects with her chest in a blink, your headbutt sends Charlie flying into the wall, then to fall down in a pitiable heap of flesh. She clutches her side now, no doubt you broke at least a couple ribs, and judging by the blood she was spitting, punctured a lung.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>&quot;Don&apos;t waste that,&quot; you order, but she&apos;s crawling away, crawling to the door with all its heavy locks. She tires this, now and then, you&apos;ll find one or two picked, and scratches at the jamb. Silly, really.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You walk up behind her, and slam your hoof down on her arm. It snaps with a satisfying scream from Charlie. She really shouldn&apos;t be doing that though, she knows that screaming only makes you angry.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You flip her over, and trap her beneath you, keeping your balled fists free to hit her face, her remaining arm, the red splotch on her neck that is leaking that sweet iquor. She screams again, so you break her jaw, crushing it against the floor. Blood trickles from the corners of her mouth and you can&apos;t help but lick at it, enthralled in each moment as if it was the first.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>She&apos;s gurgling still, between choked gasps for air. Her mouth is full of blood, and you can&apos;t help but put your tongue in there with hers, intertwining them in a beautiful display of affection.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>She tries to push you away, but your lust is insatiable, and soon her mouth is dry. She chooses to fight you still, scratching at your face with her free paw, trying to bring her teeth down on your cheek. You wrap your tongue around hers and pull it into your mouth, where you bite it off.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>It was to start the blood again, but you always loved how it wriggled inside you, and you couldn&apos;t resist letting its last spasms dance around inside your mouth. That final twitch though, it sends the tongue to the back of your throat where you swallow it, and suddenly everything makes sense.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>Is this what meat tastes like? This warm, delicious pull of flesh that you have to rip apart, the blood seeping from every wound you make? It was orgasmic, and you lose yourself for too long, because when you open your eyes again, Charlie was at the door, banging on it with all her might and desperation.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>She can&apos;t even gurgle as blood practically cascades from her mouth down her naked front. It runs all the way down her chest, perfectly splits to run each side of her slit, then down her thighs and legs to pool below her. But you can&apos;t have this. Again your skull meets your girlfriend, and again she crumples, but this time you hear a snap from her back.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>It was probably her spine, or the rest of her ribcage being smashed against the door, didn&apos;t matter. You toss her form back into the room, only to for her sounds to be answered from the other side. It is Betty, asking if Charlie was okay. You say of course she is, she just slipped in the shower, and you&apos;re taking care of her now. You don&apos;t wait for a reply.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>Charlie hasn&apos;t moved from where you&apos;d thrown her. She was practically a life-less corpse in bed anyway, so not much had changed. You break her other arm, just to be safe, and begin to clean her body of the blood she&apos;d already spilt.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>You pay special attention to her opening, which you caress with careful and tender bites, pulling tiny morsels of flesh off each time, sweet delights to tide you over as you work <span class='hidden-md hidden-sm hidden-xs'>Back to </span>her neck.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>Her eyes were still open, and they follow your snout as it tears strips of flesh from her body. You give her a smile, no reason to be like that, Charlie. You know you love her. </p>");
    Content.add("<p>Her abdomen proved to house unspeakable treasures as you pulled out foot after foot of intestines, all going down your gullet like a never-ending sausage link. Each organ you freed was a different taste, a different texture, but all were perfect.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>The liver&apos;s full of blood, and you can&apos;t help devouring it all after the first bite. The kidneys are small, but sharp in their acidity, and each disappears in one chomp. The stomach tastes like vomit, but still there was something there, something that speaks to you on a primal level.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>This is what being a pred must be like, well what being a pred was like. Now you eat bugs, and fish, and soy, and pretend. Oh, if they only knew...</p>");
    Content.add("<p>The heart was the last morsel. Still beating, still hot in your hooves, still spraying blood when you tore it out. The meat is thick, and harsh, and just the sensation of chewing it nearly makes you cum. </p>");
    Content.add("<p>You force open Charlie&apos;s rib cage, find her esophagus and slice it open with one of her own claws. You are so fucking horny, and she is so fucking hot right now. You practically tear off your pants to free your erection, and it takes you four tries to insert it into her throat from the bottom. </p>");
    Content.add("<p>Oh, but how worth it it is! You&apos;ve never fucked anyone like this before, and the sensations! It is so much better than a blowjob, so much better than sex. You lick blood off your hooves as you fuck her, each thrust pushing more of the sweet red elixir onto your dick, and within moments you&apos;ve mixed it with your own seed.</p>");
    Content.add("<p>The deed is done, you are satisfied...</p>");
    Content.add("<p>No, no you are not. There&apos;s an entire apartment full of animals here, and you are still so very, very hungry.</p>");
